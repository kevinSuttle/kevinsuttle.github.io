My session at FITC San Francisco went very well, and I'm super-humbled to have taken part in such an awe-inspiring event.

To those of you who were not able to attend or make it to my session, fear not! I've <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KevinSuttle/its-all-about-context">posted the slides</a>, and will be presenting this topic again on September 9th in a Connect session, for the Boston Flex Application Incubators Group (#BFAIG). See details <a href="http://bit.ly/8YTx2g">here</a>, and register at <a href="http://bfaig.eventbrite.com">bfaig.eventbrite.com</a>. In case you need to be sold a bit more, check out @RJOwen's <a href="http://insideria.com/2010/08/fitc-day-1-morning.html">comprehensive review</a> of @FITC day 1 on @InsideRIA. By the way, this was my first FITC event ever, and I cannot believe I let myself go this long without attending. The sessions from Theo Watson/Emily Gobeille, Eric Natzke, Brendan Dawes, Keith Peters, Robert Hodgin, and Yugo Nakamura were simply astounding. I have not been blown-away and filled with admiration and wonder like that in quite a long time. I can't do the experience justice by describing it, but once again, RJ <a href="http://insideria.com/2010/08/fitc-2---morning-ralph-hauwert.html">saves.</a> <a href="http://insideria.com/2010/08/fitc-day-2---afternoon-evening.html">the.</a> <a href="http://insideria.com/2010/08/fitc-day-3---morning-kristin-h.html">day</a>.

Even if I didn't win a ticket to a FITC event next year playing trivia on <a href="http://moock.org/blog">Colin Moock's</a> <a href="http://playmegaphone.com">Megaphone</a> platform, I'd gladly pay full ticket price to experience it again. Simply amazing job once again, <a href="http://twitter.com/pucknell">Shawn</a>! P.S. Some notes about the slides: The photography used in the backgrounds are my own original, award-winning work. My work made it into my alma-mater University of Cincinnati's Art Gallery, in the 'Best of the Decade' exhibit. I have a lot more photography work hidden away, so I decided to use it since I've been trying to do something different with my slides. Also, <a href="http://chuckstar.com/blog">Chuck Freedman</a> and I will be presenting at the <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/about/?event=117">FITC Unconference</a> at <a href="http://max.adobe.com/">MAX</a> and at <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/">RIAUnleashed</a> about multi-player gaming on the litl OS! Go <a href="http://developer.litl.com">grab the SDK</a> and start submitting channels to the litl Channel Store! UPDATE: I've just been informed that my presentation is now being featured on the Slideshare.net home page! I'm <a href="http://twitpic.com/1ppoj2">batting 1000</a> on Slideshare! Thank you all for checking out my slides! <img title="Suttle_FITCSF_Slideshare" src="/images/Suttle_FITCSF_Slideshare.png" width="600" height="214"/></a>
