  <p>I have made a career out of wielding technology as a design tool. Using science and code to improve experiences for people is what gets me up in the morning, and keeps me up at night.</p>

  <p>With strong roots in user interface, interaction, and experience design, I approach usability from a holistic, 'big-picture' perspective. Ranging anywhere from information architecture, to performance optimization, to hand-crafting UIs for mobile and TV, my deep fascination with the way people communicate through technology is what drives me to make things “the way they should be.”</p>

  <p>I care about crafting content-centered, predictable, and responsive interfaces using clean, standards-based code. I design products for mobile, touch, and typography first. In my work, the questions of ‘who’ and ‘why’ <em>always</em> come before ‘what’ and ‘how’.</p>

  <p>As both a developer and designer, a huge chunk of my work focus has been on developer experience. Here are some of the highlights. </p>
