title: "Quora, JavaScript, and Forbes"

I simply cannot get over how strange the time in which we live is. Social networks are a portayal of our [self-images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image), no matter how accurate. People can be arrested for what they post online. Online activity is no longer seen as a separate, virtual world, but rather an extenstion of our physical reality.

For the last few years, I've been somewhat active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Kevin-Suttle), an information exchange community. It's one of those places that you get as much out of as you put into. This was never more apparent than last week, when I was contacted by a publisher who works for Quora, about my answer to the question: [What is the most valuable programming language to know for the future, and why?](https://www.quora.com/Computer-Science/What-is-the-most-valuable-programming-language-to-know-for-the-future-and-why/answer/Kevin-Suttle)

Basically, the conversation consisted of the publisher telling me that she liked my answer, and that with my permission, she'd like to re-publish it on Forbes. Honestly, at first, I thought it was spam, or some kind of silly joke, but I did my homework, and sure enough, it all checked out. Quora has a content partnership with Forbes, which makes sense from a business perspective in the same way that reality television makes sense to TV network execs (you don't have to pay writers).

So, of course, I agreed, and now I have [content I'm proud of on Forbes](forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/07/14/what-is-the-most-valuable-programming-language-to-know-for-the-future-and-why/). How awesome and telling of our time is that? Thanks, Quora!

*Update:* the post on Forbes has since been viewed over _100,000_ times, and I just received a job offer because of it. Like I said, crazy times we live in.
