<p>Yeah, so the year this blog saw was kind of a bust. Sorry about that. I could honestly say I have been beyond busy with work and my personal life, but that's kind of a cop out, no matter how true. I've been doing a lot of thinking and talking with folks I really respect, and I've made some decisions. Without going into a ton of detail, I've been making an effort to define my brand identity; a process which will continue for at least the forseeable future. Why? Well, a couple of reasons.<!--more--> <strong>1. I want to be true to myself</strong> This is really the main reason for me to define my brand. I got where I am today because of Flash, but Flash is only a small fraction of my interests, and to be honest, it's not at the top. I still <strong>love</strong> the community, and the platform's technology, but I don't want to be pigeon-holed as a "flash guy." My interests lie in a myriad of design and development disciplines, the prior of which coming the most naturally. You can see the beginnings of this in <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/design/is-multiscreen-enough-why-write-once-shouldnt-be-the-goal">my first post</a> on UX Magazine.  Side note: the (short) bio I wrote for my UXMag <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/authors/kevin-suttle">author profile</a> is my most accurate to date.   <strong>2. I want to expand my horizons</strong> I started out using Illustrator and Photoshop to make UIs and art. Eventually, that turned into HTML, and then later, into Flash out of a desire to avoid cross-browser compatibly issues and because it paid the bills. However, I'm revisiting the world of web design; specifically, HTML5, jQuery, and CSS3. These are powerful technologies that I've studied enough to get a feel for their power and usefulness, but never been able to dedicate any real time to. That's already under way.  <strong>3. I want to contribute more</strong> I'm known for contributing a lot of bugs and feature requests, and sharing the occasional tip or two on Twitter, but I need to give back more. I have a few ideas that are in-progress that I hope to make public next year. We'll see how that goes.  <strong>4. It's just time for a change.</strong> I need something different, and to be excited about things again. Point number 1 above is enough to do that. Being true to myself and the things I love is a much needed and rewarding change.  Also, it's no secret that I've not been happy with Media Temple or Wordpress. Almost everyone I know has had great experiences with both services, but I have had one incident after another, and am frankly over the amount of overhead it takes to manage Wordpress. I would rather spend time posting content, not maintaining my servers and software. Expect some down time while I move my site to <a href="http://rackspacecloud.com">Rackspace</a> and a new blog engine.  With that out of the way, 2010 has been a <strong>phenomenal</strong> year. I got to join a <a href="http://litl.com">great company</a> and work with incredibly smart, humble, people, spoke at some of the <a href="http://flashandthecity.com">most</a> <a href="http://fitc.ca/sf">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/about/?event=117">conferences</a> around, and met a ton of talented and genuine people.  I have big plans for 2011, but I'm not going to make the mistake of over-promising again. I want to prove it by doing, not by saying. That said, I think you'll be really surprised.  Have a Happy New Year everyone!</p>
