<p><a href="/images/FATC-litl.png"><img title="FATC-litl" src="/images/FATC-litl.png" alt="FATC + litl = !" width="562" height="151"/></a> A few weeks ago, I was invited to join a special group of developers in Boston at <a title="litl" href="http://litl.com">litl</a> to kick the tires on the web book and preview the upcoming SDK in a hands-on training session. I wanted to take this time to publicly thank them for having me and giving me a sneak peek at the truly innovative work they are doing. I also wanted to mention, that the more people I meet at litl, the more I realize that this is a company that <strong>gets</strong> what makes a great user experience. As I said on the episode of <a title="RIARadio - litl and Flash and the City" href="http://www.insideria.com/2010/05/episode-14-litl-and-flash-and.html">RIARadio</a> which featured <a title="Chuckstar on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/chuckstar">Chuck Freedman</a> and yours truly, litl is a company that is filling a niche that people didn't even know existed. So, as a developer <em>and</em> an organizer of Flash and the City, you can understand my excitement to have them as a <a title="FATC Sponsors" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/sponsor/">sponsor</a>. Even more to my point, litl has chosen Flash and the City to make several unbelievable contributions, including an expansion of the <a title="FATC Blog - Big day for litl" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/2010/03/23/litl-will-support-flash-player-10-1/">private SDK beta</a>, sponsoring the <a title="FATC Cruise" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/2010-sessions/day-2/city-track/new-york-dinner-cruise/">Hudson River Yacht Cruise</a>, giving FATC Award winners their <a title="FATC Awards" href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/2010-sessions/day-2/technical-track/closing-ceremony-and-statue-of-liberty-award/">very own litl web book</a>, and most recently, announcing the launch of a <a title="Chuckstar blog" href="http://www.chuckstar.com/blog/?p=842">Flash-based web-TV product</a>! According to litl's Chief Evangelist... Chuck Freedman:</p>
<blockquote>"I can say that we will have a Flash-Based &ldquo;Web-Connected TV&rdquo; device on the market, running litl OS as well as ALL channels built with our new SDK."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In the coming months, our SDK will be expanded to include &ldquo;<strong>accelerometer</strong> movement, video chat, trackpad <strong>gestures</strong>, and <strong>microphone</strong> input&rdquo; that will allow open development of &ldquo;gaming, communication, entertainment and other experiences.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<blockquote>"We believe that our platform&rsquo;s use of Flash will be the best and easiest way for developers to deliver great content and applications to the TV!"</blockquote>
<p>I don't know about you, but the prospect of being able to develop for Flash-based hardware, including TVs, with an open-source SDK is simply <strong>incredible</strong>! I'm so grateful that litl will be at Flash and the City to kick off their development platform. @ChuckStar and <a title="Blog- Kathryn Rotondo" href="http://flashionista.org">Katryn Rotondo</a> will be giving an <a href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/2010-sessions/day-3/inspiration-track/a-litl-sdk-for-flash-and-flex/">overview of the litl SDK</a> in a new session on Sunday morning at 11am, and several others from litl will be on hand to answer any questions and demo the web book. Also, if you attend <a href="http://blog.flashandthecity.com/schedule/2010-sessions/day-2/inspirational-track/the-next-generation-of-flash-user-experience/">my session</a>, I <em>may</em> be mentioning and or/demoing the sample channel I built. No promises though. A lot can happen and NOT happen in 3 days. :-) See you at Flash and the City!</p>
