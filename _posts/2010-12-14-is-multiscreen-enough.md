title: Is Multiscreen Enough? Why 'Write Once' Shouldn't be the Goal
external: true
---

I wrote an article for UX Magazine about the potential pitfalls of Responsive Design. 

<blockquote><p>The literal connotation of ”multiscreen” would be ”many screens.” Sure it’s catchy, and sounds great on marketing materials, but it’s far from accurate. Though the idea of “write once, deploy everywhere” is enticing to developers and project managers alike, should that be the goal? Granted, productivity is paramount and time is money, but simply resizing the same application to fit on multiple devices doesn’t necessarily ensure the best experience for users.</p>
