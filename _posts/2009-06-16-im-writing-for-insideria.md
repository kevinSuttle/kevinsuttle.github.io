title: I'm Writing for Inside RIA
---

I've been offered an opportunity to write for [O'Reilly Media][1]'s [InsideRIA][2]! Obviously I will still post here on Commented Out [Ed Note: I actually have several posts in the works - stay tuned] but it's nice to have a more established name on the page I'm writing on.

My first post is entitled "[SkyFire Mobile Browser 1.0 and the Flash User Experience.][3]" Be sure to check it out and give me some feedback!
