title: Follow-up poll&#58; Which IDE do you use to create Flash content?
---

After the tremendous response from my [previous post][1], I was wondering if it was a good idea to create a poll to see exactly how people are developing their Flash content.

As luck would have it, shortly thereafter @RichTreolta was pinging the [Twittersphere][2] to get feedback on ideas for new [InsideRIA][3] polls. So, I submitted my idea and it was chosen! Rich has [posted a poll][4] on InsideRIA to get a feel for how the community chooses to create Flash content. Let everyone know which IDE you primarily use to create Flash content! (No multiple selections as it is now.) [http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/new-poll-what-ide-do-you-use-t.html][4]

Update: [The poll][5] is now closed with a rather paltry 369 votes. I must say I'm a little disappointed that more people didn't participate, but that doesn't mean the results are without substance. The clear favorite was Flex Builder 3, with nearly 42% reporting it as their Flash IDE of choice. I really can't say I'm surprised.

However, the most interesting tidbit was which program was in the 2nd place slot. [FlashDevelop][6] came in with almost 18% of the votes, and while I have definitely heard of it, I myself have not taken the time to see why so many developers enjoy working in it. I'll set aside some time soon to give it a test drive and report my results here. In the meantime, you can see the InsideRIA poll findings [here][7].

Thanks again to [Rich Tretola][8] for picking my poll idea!
