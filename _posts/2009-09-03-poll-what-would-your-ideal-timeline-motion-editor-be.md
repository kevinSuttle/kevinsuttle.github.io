title: Poll&#58; What would your ideal timeline&frasl;motion editor be in Flash Professional?
---

I know it's been awhile, and trust me, a ton of blog posts are coming, but I just want to see something for myself. All I want to know is what YOU, the day-in, day-out, Flasher want the timeline in Flash to look like. This is in no way sponsored by Adobe, this is strictly to satisfy my own curiosity and see what the Flash community wants. I've been working in Flash for years, and have also been asking for the After Effects timeline/motion editor for just as long. Humor me and let me know what you ALL think. What do YOU want? Let's hear it! Spread this far and wide! Just a reminder, if you vote 'Other', please explain in the comments! Thanks! - KS
